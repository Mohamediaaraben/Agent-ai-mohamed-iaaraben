    "# Using RetrieveChat with MongoDB for Retrieve Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB has been ranked as the best vector database(https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/atlas-vector-search-commands-highest-developer-nps-retool-state-ai-2023-survey) in the Retool AI report, so it is quite important to add MongoDB vector search as an option for Autogen RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily start the MongoDB vector search on a free tier M0 MongoDB Atlas cluster. Free tier cluster provides the full functionality of the MongoDB vector search.  https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/\n",
    "\n",
    "### But why is MongoDB such a standout? Well, there are a few key reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. MongoDB Atlas integrates smoothly with existing databases. For organizations already using MongoDB, this means a seamless expansion into the vector storageâ€”no major system overhauls required!\n",
    " 2. MongoDB Atlas is built to handle operational heavy-lifting. It excels when serving large-scale, mission-critical applications, offering robustness and reliability where it counts.\n",
    " 3. MongoDB's flexibility in handling a variety of data types and structures makes it perfectly suited to the complexity of vector embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, implementing MongoDB as a Retrieval Agent can unlock new potential in your AI applications, bringing the full power of vector storage to bear."
